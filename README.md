In this video, we explore the powerful MovingPandas library and its wide range of features for spatiotemporal data analysis. Using real-world shark tracking data from Guadalupe Island, Mexico, we showcase how MovingPandas can be applied to analyze movements, calculate metrics, and visualize patterns.

üìù Topics covered in this video:

- Introduction to MovingPandas and spatiotemporal data
- Loading and preprocessing shark tracking data
- Creating trajectory collections and calculating movement metrics
- Visualizing trajectories, speed distributions, and path simplifications
- Applying smoothing techniques and calculating coverage areas
- Aggregating data to generate heatmaps of shark activity
